Really old Garry's Mod gamemode, broken as fk


UPDATE 2014: The sourcecode for this gamemode has been released! It's terrible and ugly and was made when I was a teenager. Concepts, and even big hunks of code were taken mostly from DarkRP.

Use it for educational purposes. If you can get it working again, consider pushing a ticket and I'll merge it.
